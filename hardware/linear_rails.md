The RailCore II was designed around the idea of using linear rails on all the motion stages.  It's important that your rails move smoothly as that motion directly translates into your print quality.

Various Linear rails have been tested

 * Chinese Rails (various sources)
 * Genuine Hiwin Rails
 * Zyltech Linear Rails

You can rebuild your Chinese linear rails, [following the guide here](http://forum.seemecnc.com/viewtopic.php?t=12429)

For lubrication, an oil or grease with a PTFE additive is recommended.
